* Research

** Applying for job in 2020s
The US companies use résumé, not CV, which is very English. Résumé is a one-page long brief and unlike CV doesn't contain the full professional experience. Résumés are fed into ATS systems which match them against the job description and determines whether the candidate's worth looking at at all.

* Credits

- I used [[https://github.com/BruXy/resume/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file][BruXy's template]].
